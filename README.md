# memoryGame-VanillaJs
Making a memory game to learn Vanilla JavaScript. Here is the link to the article I used to create it: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae/

index.html notes:
Structure:
- All elements (all the cards) in the body are in the section class memeory-game
- Section div means: content inside is grouped, relates to a single theme

- Each card has its own div with a class of memory-card and data-name of the picture on the card
- Each card in that div has a picture on the front(with the class front-face) and back(with class back-face)
